    """Best-effort garbage collection for orphaned per-source-file mine locks.

    ``_cleanup_mine_lock_file`` reclaims a lock file correctly on the happy
    path (see its docstring) — but only for the *specific* lock a
    :func:`mine_lock` context manager just released. A process that dies
    before reaching its own ``finally`` block (killed, crashed, force-quit,
    host reboot) never runs that cleanup, and nothing else in this codebase
    later revisits that lock file. Locks in ``~/.mempalace/locks/`` can
    accumulate unboundedly over time as a result — one long-lived
    installation was found with 5,636 stale entries, the oldest several
    months old, none held by any live process (confirmed via ``lsof``).

    This reuses :func:`_cleanup_mine_lock_file` itself for the actual
    removal — same nonblocking-flock-reacquire safety mechanism, same
    Windows/POSIX handling, no duplicated locking logic. A lock is only
    ever removed after *this* process re-acquires it, so anything
    genuinely held by a live process is left untouched regardless of
    ``min_age_seconds``. ``min_age_seconds`` is a courtesy throttle only —
    it avoids racing a lock that was *just* released and may still be
    mid-rendezvous with a waiter on the same pathname; it is not a
    substitute for the flock check, which is what actually makes removal
    safe.

    Skips ``mine_palace_*.lock`` files — those belong to the newer
    palace-level :func:`mine_palace_lock` and have their own
    lifecycle/holder tracking; this targets only the per-source-file locks
    :func:`mine_lock` creates via :func:`_mine_lock_path`.

    Returns ``(reaped, skipped)`` counts, for logging/testing — callers
    don't need to act on them.
