    resolves to the configured drawers name and always succeeds.

    ``read_only=True`` asks local backends to open storage without schema
    initialization, migrations, or metadata writes. Backends that support a
    genuine read-only mode receive it through the backend ``options`` mapping.

    ``_skip_identity_check`` bypasses the embedder-identity enforcement so the
    ``set-embedder`` override path can open a palace whose recorded model
    differs from the current one (the very state it exists to repair).

    ``_skip_name_check`` is the maintenance escape hatch for tools like
    ``mempalace_repair_encoding --collection NAME`` that must be able to open a
    legacy ad-hoc collection name deliberately created before this check
    existed. Callers on this path take the risk of a mismatched-name orphan;
