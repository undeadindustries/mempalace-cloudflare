    transcripts are NOT assumed immutable: a Claude Code session keeps

    prefetch_mined_set()'s stored mtimes instead of calling this function

    """Pre-fetch source_file -> stored source_mtime for files already mined
    at the current NORMALIZE_VERSION, in one bulk pass instead of one
    ChromaDB query per file.

    Return type is a dict rather than a bare set so callers get mtime
    awareness "for free": conversation transcripts are not immutable once
    mined (a Claude Code session keeps appending to the same file while
    active, and /compact or /clear can rewrite one in place), so "we've
    seen this source_file before" is not sufficient to skip it -- the caller
    must also confirm its current on-disk mtime still matches what was
    stored. `if src in mined_set` still means the same thing as the old
    set-based return (dict `in` checks keys); a caller that wants staleness
    detection reads `mined_set[src]` and compares against
    os.path.getmtime(src) itself. `None` means either no mtime was ever
    stored (drawers written before this field existed) or getmtime failed
    when the drawer was written -- both should be treated as stale.

    When extract_mode is set, mirrors file_already_mined(..., extract_mode=...)
    so conversation mines skip per extraction mode rather than per source file.

    Completeness mirrors :func:`file_already_mined`'s ``chunk_total`` rule
    (#2183): a source that only has a mid-file partial (surviving drawers
    share the current mtime but are short of ``chunk_total``) is **omitted**
    from the result so the bulk skip path re-mines instead of permanently
    stranding the missing exchanges. Drawers with no ``chunk_total``
    (legacy rows, registry sentinels) are trusted on their own, as before.

    The convo miner walks thousands of transcript files; per-file
    `collection.get(where={"source_file": X})` costs ~2s on a 150k-drawer
    palace, making a 2000-file sweep take >1h of pure skip-checking. This
    helper drops that to a single paginated scan plus O(1) lookups.

    When `source_files` is given and holds at most `_PREFETCH_SCOPE_THRESHOLD`
    paths, the caller already knows the only source_file values that could
    possibly match, so a paged `where={"source_file": {"$in": ...}}` get()
    replaces the full-collection scan. On a one-file mine of a 660k-drawer
    palace that mtime scan was about 42% of the mine; the content-hash scan
    was the rest, and it stays unscoped because a stored hash can be several
    comma-joined values. Above the threshold, or when source_files is
    omitted, the behaviour is unchanged: a bulk sweep still benefits more
    from one full scan than from many filtered queries.

    filed at the current NORMALIZE_VERSION, in one bulk pass.

    Repeated exports from Claude/ChatGPT land under a new filename each run
    (timestamped bundle, regenerated slug, etc.) even when the conversation
    itself hasn't changed. `prefetch_mined_set` only recognizes a file as
    already-mined by its exact path, so the same conversation re-exported
    under a new path always looked "new" and got re-mined as a duplicate
    drawer. This does the same bulk scan but keyed on the SHA-256 of the
    normalized transcript text, so the convo miner can recognize "this exact
    conversation is already filed under a different path" and skip it.

    Keyed by (wing, content_hash) rather than content_hash alone — mining
    the same transcript into a second wing is a deliberate re-file, not a
    duplicate, and should produce real drawers in that wing rather than
    just the registry sentinel.

    A drawer's ``content_hash`` metadata may hold several comma-joined
    SHA-256 hashes: a privacy-export bundle normalizes to one conversation
    per drawer set, but the hash is computed per conversation so that a
    re-export with one new conversation added doesn't change the hash of
    the ones that didn't. Only the first source_file seen for a given
    (wing, hash) pair is kept — good enough to detect and skip a repeat,
    the point is not to track every alias.

    Deliberately NOT scoped by candidate source_files the way
    prefetch_mined_set is: a stored `content_hash` can hold several
    comma-joined hashes (one privacy-export bundle drawer covers several
    conversations), so a `where`-filtered query can only match a document
    whose entire stored value equals one candidate hash and would silently
    miss any bundle row. An incomplete result here is worse than none,
    because a caller reading the returned dict has no way to tell "no
    duplicate" from "the query couldn't see this row". Narrowing this scan
    correctly needs either a schema change (one hash per metadata field
    instead of a joined list) or a second index; out of scope for the fix
    that scoped prefetch_mined_set. See test_mine_convos_skips_same_content_
    under_new_filename and test_mine_convos_skips_same_conversation_within_
    re_exported_bundle, which a source_files-scoped or skipped version of
