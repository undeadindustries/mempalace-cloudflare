palace_graph.py — Graph traversal layer for MemPalace
======================================================

Builds a navigable graph from the palace structure:
  - Nodes = rooms (named ideas)
  - Edges = shared rooms across wings (tunnels)
  - Edge types = halls (the corridors)

Enables queries like:
  "Start at chromadb-setup in wing_code, walk to wing_myproject"
  "Find all rooms connected to riley-college-apps"
  "What topics bridge wing_hardware and wing_myproject?"

No external graph DB needed — built from ChromaDB metadata.

# remain distinct at ``follow_tunnels`` / ``list_tunnels`` time. The prefix
