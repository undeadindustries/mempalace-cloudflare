    host UI renders a single tool-call card (and keeps its spinner up for
    the whole save) instead of one card per underlying call.

    ``items`` is a list of ``{"wing", "room", "content"}`` dicts. ``diary``
    is an optional ``{"agent_name", "entry", "topic"?, "wing"?}`` dict.
    ``added_by`` attributes the filed drawers; when omitted it falls back to
    the diary's ``agent_name`` (and then to ``"checkpoint"``), so the agent
    that filed the session is recorded instead of a generic label.
    Reuses the existing single-item handlers so dedup/idempotency/WAL
