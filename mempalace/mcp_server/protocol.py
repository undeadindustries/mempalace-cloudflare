    The first MCP tool call that touches chromadb (``diary_write``,
    ``add_drawer``, ``search``) otherwise pays two compounding cold-load
    costs that together can exceed the MCP client timeout and surface as
    ``-32000`` "Internal tool error" with no recoverable trace on the
    agent side (#1495):

    1. ONNX/CoreML embedder init in :func:`mempalace.embedding.get_embedding_function`
       (5–30s on first inference; ChromaDB's ``ONNXMiniLM_L6_V2.__call__``
       triggers ``_download_model_if_not_exists`` + ``InferenceSession``).
    2. HNSW segment cold-load (reading ``data_level0.bin`` into RAM on
       first collection operation; seconds on palaces of 50k+ drawers).

    Warming via :func:`_get_collection`'s collection-then-query path
    covers BOTH in a single startup-phase call — mirroring the reporter's
    proposal in #1495 — so users with large existing palaces see the
    same benefit as users on the embedder-only cost path.

    Truthy parsing accepts ``1/true/yes/on`` (case-insensitive); falsy
    set ``0/false/no/off`` and empty/whitespace are silently off; any
    other value logs a warning and stays off so typos like ``tru`` do
    not silently disable the feature.

    Fresh-install guard (pre-check, NOT a catch): ``_get_collection``'s
    retry layer absorbs ``_ChromaNotFoundError`` and returns ``None`` while
    also materialising ``chroma.sqlite3`` on disk via the chromadb client
    constructor. To preserve the documented "no palace yet → nothing to
    warm" contract WITHOUT writing palace scaffolding before
    ``mempalace init`` (which would violate CLAUDE.md "Incremental only"),
    we test for ``chroma.sqlite3`` ourselves before touching the chromadb
    client. Operators who set ``MEMPALACE_EAGER_WARMUP=1`` in their MCP
    config and launch the server before running ``mempalace init`` get a
    single INFO line and no on-disk side effect.

    Fail-soft beyond the fresh-install pre-check:

    * **Backend open failure** (palace path misconfigured, file locked,
      corrupted HNSW that ``quarantine_stale_hnsw`` cannot recover) →
      log exception with device + palace context and return. The next
      embedding-requiring call sees the same fail mode it would have
      without warmup.
    * **`_get_collection` retried and returned None** → palace exists
      but chromadb cannot open the collection (rare; usually a stale
      sqlite + segment-files mismatch surfaced by `_get_client` rebuild).
      A warning suffices because the retry layer already wrote two
      tracebacks with the underlying chromadb error class.
    * **Query failure** (network failure during ONNX model download,
      provider init crash, runtime decoder error) → log exception with
      device + palace context and return. Same fail-mode preservation.

    Note: on an existing palace with an empty collection (created via
    ``mempalace init`` but never written to), ``col.query`` succeeds but
    returns ``{'ids': [[]]}`` without reading any HNSW segment — the
    embedder warms but there is no HNSW segment to load. The success log
    still says ``embedder + HNSW ready`` because the no-HNSW-segment case
    has zero cold-load cost; nothing was skipped that the first real tool
    call would have paid.
