# Stale-library write gate (#899).
#
# A long-lived MCP server imports mempalace and its storage backend once and
# then serves from those in-memory modules for the whole life of the process.
# Upgrading the package on disk mid-session (`pip install -U mempalace`,
# `uv tool upgrade`, `pipx install --force`) cannot reach it: Python caches
# modules in sys.modules and never reloads them. The server keeps accepting
# writes, produced by code the user no longer has installed, and reports
# success for every one of them.
#
# #457 is the same condition with the volume turned up: upgrading mempalace
# tightened its ChromaDB pin and moved the installed ChromaDB across a
# storage-format boundary (downwards, 1.5.6 to 0.6.3), the running server kept
# serving the modules it had already loaded, and every tool call then failed
# with `no such column: collections.schema_str` until the host was restarted. That one
# announced itself. #899 reports the quiet variant, where the writes succeed in
# a format the newly-installed library may not read back and nothing surfaces
# until a fresh process opens the palace. Either way nothing told the running
# server to stop first; `mempalace migrate` (#502) only recovers such a palace
# after the fact.
#
# Watched distributions are the ones whose code writes the palace on this
# machine: mempalace itself, plus chromadb when chromadb is the backend
# actually serving. Its on-disk format has moved between releases, which is
# what makes a superseded copy of it dangerous. The networked backends
# (pgvector/qdrant/milvus) keep their format server-side, so a client-library
# upgrade does not rewrite local files the same way, and they are deliberately
# left out rather than gated on a guess.
#
# chromadb is a hard dependency rather than an extra, so it is installed even
# for someone serving from pgvector, and watching it unconditionally would
# refuse that person's writes over an upgrade to a library that touches nothing
# they own. The backend is read from _config here at import, and again when
# _apply_server_flags() applies --backend. One that cannot be resolved counts as
# chroma: watching a distribution that turns out not to matter costs a restart, while
# not watching the one that does costs the silent corruption this exists to
# prevent.
#
# The resolved versions are cached behind a stat-only fingerprint, so the common
# case reads no metadata at all. That is not the same as free: building the
# fingerprint lists every search root once and stats the watched metadata files
# it finds there, and on a normal environment the listing is most of the cost.
# It is paid only by mutating tools — the refusal checks the tool name before
# anything else, so a read leaves the filesystem alone entirely. The one
# exception among reads is mempalace_status, which pays it deliberately, being
# the surface that reports this state.
#
# The cache is invalidated by that fingerprint and never by elapsed time,
# because a time window is precisely the gap a post-upgrade write slips
# through. The fingerprint covers what installers actually do: a renamed or
# removed metadata directory, and a metadata file rewritten in place. It cannot
# see a rewrite that leaves both the size and the recorded mtime untouched,
# which needs the replacement to be the same length AND to land inside the
# filesystem's timestamp granularity — nanoseconds on ext4, but roughly 15 ms
# on Windows and two seconds on FAT. An upgrade arriving minutes into a session
# clears that comfortably; an archive restore or a rewrite in the same tick as
# the previous reading does not, and that case fails open, leaving the gate no
# worse than its absence.
# -32004 belongs to the diverged-index gate; this one takes the next free code
# so a client can tell "restart the server" from "rebuild the index" without
# parsing the message.

    ``sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Cannot operate on a closed database`` and
    bubbles up as a -32000 to the MCP client even though the user just
    asked for a reconnect.

    Catch that single class of error, evict the stale entry from the

    runs instead of masking a ``sqlite3.ProgrammingError`` mid-retry.
