    Used by the MCP server and other callers that need data.

    Each hit exposes ``filed_at`` (also retained as ``created_at``), plus
    the legacy ``authored_at`` value and ``authored_at_source`` indicating
    whether it came from stored ``authored_at``, the ``filed_at`` fallback,
    or is ``unknown``. ``content_date`` is a separate inferred date with
    ``content_date_source`` (filename/frontmatter/body/mtime when recorded,
    otherwise ``unknown``). Neither inference nor filing proves authorship.

    Args:
        query: Natural language search query.
        palace_path: Path to the ChromaDB palace directory.
        wing: Optional wing filter.
        room: Optional room filter.
        source_file: Optional exact source_file filter. Matches the full
            stored source_file value verbatim (#1815).
        since: Optional inclusive ISO date/datetime lower bound on a
            drawer's ``filed_at`` (ingest time, the ``created_at`` shown in
            results) — ``[since, before)`` window semantics shared with
            ``list_drawers`` (#1128): wall-clock naive comparison, drawers
            with missing/unparseable ``filed_at`` excluded while a bound is
            active. Filtering happens after retrieval (ChromaDB rejects
            string operands for ``$gte``/``$lt``), so the candidate pool is
            widened via ``_candidate_pool_size`` — see
            ``date_filter_pool_truncated`` in the response.
        before: Optional exclusive ISO upper bound; see ``since``.
        n_results: Max results to return.
        max_distance: Max cosine distance threshold. The palace collection uses
            cosine distance (hnsw:space=cosine) — 0 = identical, 2 = opposite.
            Results with distance > this value are filtered out. A value of
            0.0 disables filtering. Typical useful range: 0.3–1.0.
        vector_disabled: When True, route to the sqlite-only BM25 fallback
            (#1222). Set by the MCP server when the HNSW capacity probe
            detects a divergence that would segfault chromadb on segment
            load.
        candidate_strategy: How candidates for the hybrid re-rank are gathered.

            * ``"vector"`` (default) — preserves historical behavior: top
              ``n_results * 4`` rows from the vector index are the rerank pool.
              Cheap; works well when query and target docs agree in the
              embedding space.
            * ``"union"`` — also pull top ``n_results * 3`` lexical candidates
              through the backend's ``lexical_search`` capability and merge
              them into the rerank pool (deduped by source_file). Catches docs
              with strong BM25 signal that are vector-distant from the query.
              Perf depends on the selected backend; opt in until the cost is
              characterized.

              When ``max_distance > 0.0`` is also set, BM25-only candidates
              are admitted only if their stored embeddings can be loaded and
              their computed vector distance satisfies that threshold.
        lang: Locale code for BM25 stop-word filtering (opt-in). When
            omitted, reads ``MempalaceConfig().lang_explicit`` — returns an
            empty set unless the user has set ``MEMPALACE_LANG`` /
            ``MEMPAL_LANG`` or ``config.json["lang"]``. Palaces without an
            explicit language skip filtering entirely, preserving pre-PR
            byte-identical scoring.

# Drawers are stored verbatim on disk. The reader applies a line-number grid
# at read time so any drawer — numbered or not — can be sectioned by a closet
# pointer like ``→2026-01-18:L55-L72`` without rewriting the corpus. Pure
# functions, no I/O. Source drawer text is never mutated.
# See docs/virtual-line-numbering.md for the full design rationale.

# A line is "already numbered" iff it starts with [<digits>].
