"""Python ``sqlite3`` access to a database another SQLite library in this process holds.

ChromaDB 1.5+ opens ``chroma.sqlite3`` through the SQLite statically linked
into ``chromadb_rust_bindings``. mempalace's fast paths (status, taxonomy,
``list_drawers``, BM25, the integrity gate, repair) open the same file through
Python's ``sqlite3``: a second, independent SQLite library in the same
process. Two consequences, both measured on Linux:

1. POSIX fcntl locks belong to the (process, inode) pair. When a Python
   connection closes its descriptor, the kernel drops every lock the process
   holds on that file, Chroma's included: the SHARED lock a WAL connection
   keeps for its whole life and the DMS lock on ``-shm``. SQLite's unix VFS
   parks a descriptor instead of closing it only while a connection of *its
   own* library holds locks on the inode. After a single fast-path read Chroma
   never takes those locks back, so the palace stays lock-naked to every
   other process: a newcomer takes the "first opener" path and truncates
   ``-shm``, or a clean close checkpoints and unlinks ``-wal``/``-shm`` under
   the live writer.
2. fcntl locks never conflict within one process, so neither library sees the
   other's. A ``quick_check`` running while Chroma commits reads a torn page
   set (``database disk image is malformed``), and a close in that window
   also releases the write transaction's locks.

This module is the one door for that access.

* :func:`palace_db_lock` is a process-local re-entrant lock per database file.
  Every connection opened here holds it from open to close, and
  ``ChromaBackend`` holds it around its writes and client opens, so the two
  libraries never overlap inside the process. That fixes (2) everywhere.
* On Linux, before a reader opens, an idle *anchor* connection is kept on the
  database inode for the life of the process. It reads nothing but the schema
  cookie, which in WAL mode leaves it holding SHARED and the wal-index mapping,
  so Python's SQLite parks the descriptor of every per-call connection that
  closes afterwards instead of closing it, and Chroma keeps its locks (1).
  The anchor also holds open-file-description (OFD) read locks on SQLite's
  SHARED range and on the ``-shm`` DMS byte. OFD locks belong to a descriptor
  rather than to the process: no other close releases them, and they conflict
  with the process-associated locks of this very process. Without them a
  long-lived Python connection is worse than none. Chroma's last close takes
  EXCLUSIVE straight past the anchor's in-process locks, the next open
  recreates ``-wal``/``-shm``, and every Python connection stays attached to
  the stale wal-index, blind to later commits (measured: a fresh connection saw
  1 of 3 committed rows). With the guards held, nobody can take EXCLUSIVE or
  the DMS write lock while the anchor lives, exactly as if another process held
  a WAL reader. In rollback-journal mode the anchor holds nothing between reads
  and Chroma holds nothing between transactions, so the lock covers the close.
* The reads themselves always use a fresh connection. A long-lived one is not a
  substitute: after Chroma's commits, Python's SQLite (3.45.1 measured) kept
  reporting ``malformed inverted index for FTS5 table`` from it, in either
  journal mode and after Chroma had closed, while fresh connections and a later
  ``integrity_check`` said ``ok``.
* Everywhere else connections open and close per call, still under the lock.
  Windows locks belong to a handle, so a close never drops another handle's
  locks. POSIX platforms without OFD locks (macOS) keep the same promise with
  a helper process: its WAL read transaction is another process's SHARED
  lock, so it conflicts with Chroma where an in-process fcntl lock
  would not, and closing a connection in this process cannot drop it. The
  in-process anchor is installed only after that helper is holding, so
  Chroma cannot recreate ``-wal``/``-shm`` under a parked wal-index.
