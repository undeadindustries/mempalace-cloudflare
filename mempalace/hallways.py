"""Hallways — within-wing entity-to-entity connectors.

A **hallway** is a connection between two entities (people, projects,
concepts, interests) inside one wing, materialized from their
co-occurrence across that wing's drawers. Conceptually:

    WING → has DRAWERS (each tagged with entities)
            entities → connected to other entities by HALLWAYS
                       (within-wing, built from drawer co-occurrence)
                       hallways → are the primitive
                                   tunnels → use hallways to spawn
                                             cross-wing connections

If Aya and Lumi are both mentioned in 47 drawers across the diary,
letters, and ideas rooms, there's a hallway between them. If Aya
and "consciousness" co-occur in 19 drawers, there's a hallway between
them too. The hallway *is* the structural fact of "these two entities
travel together inside this wing."

Mempalace's tunnel primitive in ``palace_graph.py`` connects rooms
across wings. This module fills the within-wing gap with an
entity-centric (not room-centric) model: hallways are about *who/what
relates to whom/what*, not *which rooms relate to which*. A planned
follow-up PR will refactor ``_compute_topic_tunnels_for_wing`` to
build cross-wing tunnels from hallway data (Wing → Drawer-entities →
Hallway → Tunnel).

Persistence mirrors ``palace_graph._TUNNEL_FILE``: a JSON file under
``~/.mempalace/`` so the records survive across mines and are
inspectable / editable by hand if needed.

    Args:
        wing: wing name to scan.
        col: ChromaDB collection — must support paginated
            ``.get(where={"wing": ...}, limit=..., offset=..., include=...)``.
            The fetch is scoped to ``wing`` server-side AND paginated: an
            unbounded ``.get(where=...)`` binds one SQL variable per matched
            id and overflows SQLite's ``SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER`` on wings
            above ~32k drawers (#1619), while an unscoped page walk costs
            O(total palace drawers) on every mine, pegging the CPU for
            minutes on large palaces (#2466). A bounded page never binds more
            than ``batch_size`` ids. Fake collections and alternate backends
            must implement this shape. If ``None``, returns ``[]`` (caller
            didn't supply a backing store, so nothing to compute against).
            Tests pass a controlled MagicMock.
        min_count: minimum co-occurrence count required to materialize a
            hallway between two entities. Default 2 — single co-occurrences
            are noise (entities mentioned together once in one drawer);
            two or more is a real signal. Clamped to ``>=1``.
        config: Optional ``MempalaceConfig`` selecting the palace-scoped
            hallway sidecar. Callers using an explicit palace path must pass
            the matching config so derived graph state cannot leak into the
            default palace.

    Returns:
        List of hallway dicts created for this wing. Records for other
        wings already on disk are preserved.
