# CLI write routing

Routine CLI writes consume the shared routing policy introduced for the Tier 3
rollout tracked in #1963.

## Routed commands

The policy applies to:

- `mempalace mine`;
- `mempalace sweep`;
- `mempalace sync`;
- the optional post-setup mine run by `mempalace init`.

## Policies

### `direct`

Use the existing direct in-process execution path.

### `prefer`

Submit through the local daemon. Interactive CLI commands are allowed to start
the daemon when it is not already running.

### `require`

Submit through the local daemon. Interactive CLI commands are allowed to start
the daemon when it is not already running.

For CLI commands, `prefer` and `require` both select the daemon because daemon
startup is permitted. Their difference remains meaningful to hook callers,
which cannot cold-start the daemon.

## Explicit flags

Force daemon execution:

    mempalace mine ./project --daemon

Force direct execution:

    mempalace mine ./project --direct

The flags are mutually exclusive and override environment/config policy.

### Mining with a running HTTP hub

On the direct route, compatible `mine` commands forward to a running HTTP hub
for the same palace, since the hub holds its writer lease. Project mining with
`--include-ignored` preserves the requested project-relative paths through this
route; other ignored files remain excluded.

This requires a hub advertising the `mine_include_ignored` capability. If a
running hub is older, the CLI asks you to upgrade MemPalace in the hub's
environment and restart it before retrying. It does not drop the override,
submit the mine, or attempt a competing local write. With no live hub, the
existing local mining behavior remains available.

Other flags the hub cannot express, such as `--no-gitignore`, still use the
local path. An uncertain hub submission is never replayed locally.

### Background execution

    mempalace mine ./project --background

`--background` is valid when the selected route is the daemon. A direct route
with `--background` exits with a configuration error.

## Configuration

Use the daemon for routine CLI writes:

    MEMPALACE_CLI_WRITE_ROUTING=prefer

Prohibit an accidental direct route:

    MEMPALACE_CLI_WRITE_ROUTING=require

Retain direct behavior:

    MEMPALACE_CLI_WRITE_ROUTING=direct

Config file:

    {
      "write_routing": {
        "cli": "require"
      }
    }

## Defaults and rollout

The default remains `direct` in this PR.

This means existing users receive no silent execution-topology change. A
supervised Tier 3 deployment enables `prefer` or `require` explicitly. The
production default can be changed later after the stacked rollout is reviewed.

## Safety properties

- Daemon submission errors never trigger direct fallback.
- A failed or ambiguous submission may already have created a durable job;
  retrying directly could duplicate content.
- Post-init mining forwards the already-scanned file list into the daemon, so
  the project is not scanned twice.
- `sweep` is now a first-class daemon job.
- `--direct` remains an explicit emergency/debug escape hatch.
- No low-level lock behavior is changed.

## Maintenance exclusions

These remain outside ordinary routing:

- repair;
- migration and wing migration;
- index rebuild;
- closet compression;
- embedder identity changes.

They can replace indexes, rewrite broad metadata sets, or require all cached
handles to close. They need an exclusive-maintenance protocol rather than an
ordinary queued-write job.
